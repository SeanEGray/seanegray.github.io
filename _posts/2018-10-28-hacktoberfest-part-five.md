BOOM! Five commits!

Last commit was an update to the PowerShell Core documentation; assuming it gets merged and released, when you type
```pwsh
   Get-Help about_automaticVariables
```
you'll see actual words that I wrote in a coffee shop, telling you about some of the new built-in variables that PowerShell Core has, indicating what operating system it's running on.

I'm quite pleased with this one, because while it was simple enough, it's something that'll be seen by A LOT of people, and better documentation is always welcome.

I'll probably do future commits to this project in future, as I come across things that need correcting or updating.
