I want to contribute more to open source projects; we all benefit from open source software these days, and I think that the community effort that goes into help each other is amazing. I'd like to give something back to that.

While I have some plans for projects I'd like to contribute to, I noticed that it's [Hacktoberfest!](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) (which I strongly encourage you to take part in) so it'd be nice to contribute to some repos this month and see if I can get a t-shirt. It stops me putting things off, anyway.

Earlier today, I stumbled upon [https://github.com/ghostinthewires/Team-Handbook-Template]; it's a template for making a team handbook to help keep track of information about processes that can help onboarding new team members. It's a great idea, but I spotted what I think was a small typo, so my first pull request of Hacktoberfest is a really tiny typo-fix. I plan to do some meatier pull requests, but it's a start, and every little helps!
