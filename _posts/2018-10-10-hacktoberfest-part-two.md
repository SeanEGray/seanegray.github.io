My second Hacktoberfest pull request is [this one](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/pull/5301). It's a tiny update, which I came across by essentially browsing the issues lists of projects that I'm interested in, and that I thought there was a reasonable chance I could contribute to in the timescale allowed.

Hacktoberfest is a great idea, but I think I'd be better at it in a few months. I'd really like to make more substantial contributions, but I'm finding that the languages and technologies I know best aren't the ones that are used very often in open source software (arguably, that's a different problem that I should look to solve). I do have a few things that I'm learning at the moment, but I suspect that it'll be a little while before I get them to a level where I'm comfortable submitting code to public repos.
